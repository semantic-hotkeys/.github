# Contributing Guide

Be nice and respect the maintainers' time. ðŸ˜„

## Contribute

Contributions aren't exclusively code, and can also include:

- Fixing typos
- Improving documentation
- Sharing your opinion _constructively_

## Issues

- Use issue templates if they're available
- Low-effort issues will be closed
- Search for existing issues before opening a new one
- Don't needlessly bump issues. Like seriously, _don't_

## Pull Requests

- For large or breaking changes, open an issue first
- Don't perform unrelated changes
- Adhere to the existing code style
- Please double-check your changes
- You must make PRs from a branch that's different than the default one
